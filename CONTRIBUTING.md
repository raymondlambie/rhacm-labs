Goals

- More stability : meCoffee only has a limited set of devices ( tablets/phones ) available, if a problem occurs on a specific device it would be great if we could get fixes in meBarista sooner
- More creativity : if features are wanted or somebody is a designer who can make things look good, all the better
- More freedom : by doing meBarista in the open, meCoffee owners are guaranteed access to meBarista on their terms

Proces

- Create a feature-branch with a coherent set of changes : so if you have fixes for the latest iPhone and a nifty new feature for the home screen, create separate feature branches 'feature-iPhoneX-fixes' and 'feature-home-gauge-update'
- When you are confident, create a pull-request
- Pull request will be evaluated by meCoffee
- A beta will be distributed through TestFlight(iOS) or the beta channel(Android)
- Eventual release to production
